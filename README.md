### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Recruiters: I am not looking for a job! Project or long term contracting available**

I'm a web developer and system engineer specialized on PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, Docker and Kubernetes.

I make my life easy by building backends using Laravel and frontends with React and Tailwind.
I automate everything from testing, container image builds, to deployments, backups and recovery strategies.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Dewberry (soon to announce it).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more Kubernetes, React, TypeScript, advanced SQL.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me at the email you can see here on the profile.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I think we must open source society.
