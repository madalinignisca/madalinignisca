### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer and system engineer specialized on PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, Docker and Kubernetes.

I make my life easy by building backends using Laravel and frontends with React/NextJS and Tailwind/Daisy.
Filament completes the administration panels for apps.

I automate everything from testing, container image builds, to deployments, backups and recovery strategies.

I can manage, support and lead teams for large and complex projects.
