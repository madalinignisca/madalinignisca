### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer and system engineer specialized on PHP, JavaScript, Postgresql, Docker and Kubernetes.

I make my life easy by building backend using Laravel and frontend with Vue and Tailwind.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Dewberry (soon to announce it).
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more Kubernetes and Postgresql.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: email me at the email you can see here on the profile.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I think we must open source society.
