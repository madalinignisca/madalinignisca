### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer and system engineer specialized on Go and JavaScript/TypeScript.

I make my life easy by building backends using GO and frontends with React/NextJS/Remix and Tailwind/Daisy.

I automate everything from testing, container image builds, to deployments, backups and recovery strategies.

I can manage, support and lead teams for large and complex projects.

Contact me if you want to talk about an interesting project.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal project [No Sweat Cloud](https://nosweat.cloud).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more Kubernetes, React, TypeScript, and play with ML/AI.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me at the email you can see here on the profile.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I think we must open source society.
